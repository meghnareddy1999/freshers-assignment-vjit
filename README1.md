# Garbage Notifier Application - 
#### A technological solution to various contaminations!

## Introduction
A garbage notifier application is one which helps a person to let the government / the responsible muncipality about the waste that is lying in a particular area that the person came across. 
Just like how any other software project is developed, either by using the traditional SDLC methodology or using latest methodologies like the DevOps, I went about with this project as well. s far as the planning is concerned, I made a flow that the application would follow. Accordingly, I identified the requirements - such as the IDE in which it was going to be developed and the type of files that I would use in order to store the data and access it. Post which, I divided the project into small parts and worked on the code. I tested the little snippets of code using multiple inputs. After combining the little snippets with one another, I produced the .jar file that I recently uploaded.

## The Flow 
Cleaniness is the cause of destruction of many things and approaching that problem technologically is making me feel better about 
the profession that I am going to be a part of.
As a part of the solution, I have followed the instructions given in the README file. Initially, a user is asked whether 
he's a new user or an existing user. In case he's a new user, his details are taken as the input and stored inside the XML 
file using the DOM Parser concepts and extremely handy classes like DocumentBuilder. I initially tried implementing it using JSON objects by adding a couple of maven dependencies instead of downloading the required packages. It produced a couple of errors that 
were a little hard to comprehend. It's because of that - that I went ahead and implemented the DOM Parsers concept. In case the user is
old, I retrieved his credentials from the XML file and compared it with the input that the user gave. Post the verification/ registration, the user is asked about the catgory of waste that he'd like to report. Based on the category and the quantity entered by the user, the points will be generated and a random coupon code ( Using different string variables like numbers, alphabets, and special characters and concatenating them. They can be called by using the using the math.random() which generates random codes) that are displayed to the user along with the number of points that heâ€™d earned.will be assigned to it and notified to the user. Inspired by the DevOps way of operating, I wrote little snippets of code and kept testing them (and deploying it on GitHub). 

## Technologies Used for Implementation 
1. The 4.7 version of the Eclipse IDE was installed. While creating the project, the category was chosen as Maven (in order to deal with the dependencies with ease.)
2. Classes like Document, DocumentBuilder, DocumentBuilderFactory - belonging to the javax.xml package were used in order to read from and write to an XML file. 


### I would like to propose to a couple of additional ideas that could add a couple of extra advantages.
1. Making use of a could provider like AWS or Azure in order to store the details of the user. Considering the fact that the amount of 
data that could be generated is unpredictable and depends on the success of the app, the scalability and pay as you go feature will help
in making sure that we invest just the right amount in deploying the app. We could host our website using an EC2 instance and attach it 
with either an EBS/NFS/S3 type of storage. Since health checks are available, we will easily get notified if the application id down.
2. Implementing a couple of machine learning techniques that can help us do the following :
  1) Identify loyal users who use the app more frequently and give them extra rewards for loyalty.
  2) Identify the inactive users and send them notifications that can motivate them to use the app more, hence quicken the process of 
  cleaning the nation.
  3) Identify the users who registered but never used the app - and ask them to make their first ever step towards a cleaner planet.
  4) Analyse how much the app is being used in order to come up with new ideas to increase the usage.
3. Since the application is more likely to be deployed by the government, and presuming that most of the citizens have an aadhar card that 
has their thumb prints, we could give a sign in option as their finger print it self and match it with the one in the database. That way 
the user doesn't have to remember their password!
